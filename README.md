# FlowPilot

A WhatsApp Appointment Conversion System. Book more, chase less.

**Current stage:** Local Vertical Discovery Strategy — the same generic booking
engine is being tested across multiple appointment-based businesses (dental,
beauty, coaching, gyms, education, services) before selecting a winning
vertical. **The UI and domain model stay completely vertical-agnostic.**

## Getting Started

One-time bootstrap per platform (verifies node/pnpm/git/gh, installs only what
is missing, then sets up the project):

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh                  # macOS / Linux
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\bootstrap.ps1   # Windows
bash scripts/bootstrap-termux.sh           # Termux (Android)
```

Then set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` (created automatically with a random
auth secret) and start development:

```bash
bash scripts/dev.sh                        # or dev.ps1 / dev-termux.sh
```

Prefer the manual path? Equivalent commands:

```bash
pnpm run setup       # env file (safe, never overwrites) + install + prisma generate
pnpm run doctor      # environment diagnostics
pnpm dev             # http://localhost:3000 (use --webpack on Termux)
```

Full platform guide: [docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md).

### Environment variables

See `.env.example`:

| Variable              | Purpose                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Neon PostgreSQL connection string       |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`  | Auth signing secret (min 32 chars)      |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL`     | Base URL used by Better Auth            |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public app URL (also used for metadata) |

All server env vars are validated at runtime with Zod in `src/lib/env.ts` —
the app fails fast with a readable message if anything is missing. Env files
(`.env*`) are gitignored; `.env.local` takes precedence over `.env` in the dev
server, Prisma CLI, and seed script alike.

```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Routes are thin.** `src/app` files render feature components; no business
   logic in route files.
2. **Features are isolated.** A feature may import from `@/components/ui`,
   `@/lib/*`, `@/server/*`, `@/types`, and itself — never from another
   feature. Cross-feature composition happens at the route layer.
3. **No circular dependencies.** If two features share logic, promote it to
   `@/lib` or `@/server` deliberately.
4. **No giant shared files.** Prefer many small, single-purpose modules over
   shared barrels and mega-utils.
5. **Strong typing everywhere.** Strict TS is on (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
   `noUnusedLocals`, …). Validate inputs with Zod at the boundary; infer
   types from schemas instead of hand-writing duplicates.
6. **Server layer is reusable.** DB access goes through the `db` singleton
   (`src/server/db`). Never construct ad-hoc clients.
7. **UI is reusable and generic.** Build on shadcn/ui primitives; keep all
   copy free of vertical-specific terminology (this is a hard product rule
   during vertical discovery).
8. **Quality gates before pushing:**
   ```bash
   pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm format:check && pnpm build
   ```
9. **Imports are auto-sorted** by Prettier (`@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`)
   with Tailwind class sorting enabled.

## Notes

- Demo: realistic Arabic dataset with demo logins — `docs/DEMO_GUIDE.md`
  (setup, scenarios) and `docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` (5-minute sales walkthrough).
  Client-facing demo package (URL + credentials + what to show):
  `docs/CLIENT_DEMO.md`. Set `DEMO_MODE=true` in `.env.local` to auto-seed on
  dev launch **and** before every deploy (`pnpm deploy` runs it as part of its
  gate, so deployed demos are never empty).
- Database layer (schema, validation, repositories, seed): see
  [docs/DATABASE.md](docs/DATABASE.md).
- This project uses the current Next.js release (16.x), which differs from
  Next.js 13–15 habits: request APIs (`cookies()`, `params`, `searchParams`)
  are async, `middleware.ts` is replaced by `proxy.ts`, and error boundaries
  receive `{ error, retry }`. See `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.
- Prisma client is generated to `src/generated/prisma` (gitignored) and uses
  the `pg` driver adapter for Neon compatibility.
