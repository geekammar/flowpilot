# FlowPilot — Vercel Deployment Guide

> Step-by-step: from this repository to a live, shareable FlowPilot URL.
> **In a hurry? `VERCEL_QUICK_DEPLOY.md` deploys in under 5 minutes.**
> Companion reference: `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` · Audit: `VERCEL_AUDIT.md`.
> Requirements: a [Neon](https://neon.tech) PostgreSQL database and (for the
> GitHub-connected flow) the repo pushed to GitHub (`pnpm release` handles that).

## TL;DR

1. Neon database exists + schema applied (`pnpm db:deploy` from desktop).
2. Push repo to GitHub (private).
3. Vercel → Import the repo → add the 4 environment variables → Deploy.
4. Open `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/health` →
   `{"status":"ok","deploymentReady":true,…}`.
5. Sign in with the demo credentials (after `pnpm db:seed` on the demo DB, or
   set `DEMO_MODE=true` so deploys seed automatically).

CLI alternative to steps 2–3 (single command, gates first):

```bash
pnpm deploy        # env + DB + Prisma + auth + build gates → production URL
```

## SECTION 1 — Create Vercel Project

1. Sign up / log in at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) (free Hobby plan is
   enough for pilots; the team's Pro plan works identically).
2. Click **Add New… → Project**.
3. Do **not** continue past the import screen yet — the repository must be on
   GitHub first (Section 2). If you prefer deploying straight from this
   machine without GitHub, see **CLI path** at the end of Section 2.
4. When prompted, **do not** create a database through Vercel's marketplace
   wizard — FlowPilot uses its own Neon project (Architecture: Vercel + Neon).

What Vercel auto-detects from the repo (no action needed):

| Setting         | Detected value                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework       | Next.js (16, App Router)                              |
| Package manager | pnpm (`packageManager` field + `pnpm-lock.yaml`)      |
| Build command   | `pnpm db:generate && pnpm build` (from `vercel.json`) |
| Node.js         | default (satisfies `engines.node >= 20.9.0`)          |

## SECTION 2 — Connect GitHub Repository

1. Push the repository to GitHub if not done yet:

   ```bash
   gh auth login          # once per machine
   pnpm release           # gated: creates private repo flowpilot + pushes main
   ```

   (Manual equivalent: `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`.)

2. Back in Vercel **Add New… → Project**, find the private `flowpilot` repo
   (grant Vercel access to private repos when asked) and press **Import**.
3. Pick a project name — it becomes the URL: `<name>.vercel.app`
   (e.g. `flowpilot-demo` → `https://flowpilot-demo.vercel.app`).
4. Leave the Framework/Build settings as auto-detected (they come from
   `vercel.json`).

**CLI path (no GitHub needed):** deploy directly from this machine instead —

```bash
pnpm deploy:check             # full readiness gate: env + database + Prisma + auth + demo + build
pnpm dlx vercel@latest login  # once per machine
pnpm dlx vercel@latest link   # once per project (follow prompts)
pnpm deploy                   # production deployment (same full gate, then deploy → URL)
pnpm deploy:preview           # preview deployment (auth may not work on preview URLs)
```

Every push to `main` (GitHub flow) then redeploys automatically — that is the
"easy to redeploy" loop: `pnpm verify` → commit → push → Vercel builds.

## SECTION 3 — Configure Environment Variables

**This must be done BEFORE the first deploy** — the build fails fast
(Arabic Zod error) if any variable is missing.

In Vercel: **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**, add each of the
four (see `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` for exact formats and generation):

| Name                  | Example value                     | Environments        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | `postgresql://…​?sslmode=require` | Production, Preview |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`  | 64-char random string             | Production, Preview |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL`     | `https://<your-app>.vercel.app`   | Production, Preview |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `https://<your-app>.vercel.app`   | Production, Preview |

Rules that bite:

- Generate the secret once and reuse it everywhere (`node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64'))"`).
  A different secret per environment invalidates sessions of the other one.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must match the **production**
  domain. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is baked in at build time.
- Preview deployments share these values → test auth flows on the production
  domain (preview hosts are not in `trustedOrigins`).
- Apply the database schema **before** the first successful deploy:

  ```bash
  pnpm db:deploy     # prisma migrate deploy — run from desktop (not Termux)
  ```

Sanity-check locally first — the same validation the deploy gate runs:

```bash
pnpm vercel:check
```

## SECTION 4 — Deploy

1. In the Vercel import screen (Section 2) press **Deploy** — or, for an
   existing project, **Deployments → … → Redeploy**, or just push to `main`.
2. First build takes ~2–4 minutes. The build runs
   `pnpm db:generate && pnpm build` (Prisma client is gitignored and must be
   regenerated on every build — handled automatically).
3. If the build fails, the error is shown inline — see Section 6.

Local alternative with the same guarantees (readiness gate first, explains
failures, returns the deployment URL):

```bash
pnpm deploy:check       # env + database + Prisma + auth + demo + build → READY / NOT READY
pnpm deploy:preview     # full gate → preview deployment URL
pnpm deploy             # full gate → production deployment URL (deploy:production = alias)
```

## SECTION 5 — Validate Deployment

1. **Liveness & readiness** — open `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/api/health`:

   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "environment": "production",
     "timestamp": "2026-08-29T…Z",
     "deploymentReady": true,
     "database": "connected",
     "missingEnvVars": []
   }
   ```

   `deploymentReady: false` with `database: "unreachable"` → wake/check the
   Neon project before demoing (idle-suspended databases are the usual cause).

2. **Database** — sign in at `/sign-in` (needs seeded demo users on the DB:
   `pnpm db:seed` from desktop). If login works, Better Auth ↔ Neon are wired.
3. **PWA** — on Android Chrome: install prompt appears, home-screen icon is
   the FlowPilot mark, offline page shows in airplane mode.
4. **RTL/Arabic** — pages render `dir="rtl"`, Arabic copy, IBM Plex Sans Arabic.
5. **Redeploy loop** — make a change → `pnpm verify` → commit → push →
   Vercel rebuilds → `/api/health` shows the new version after you bump
   `version` in `package.json`.

## SECTION 6 — Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                                             | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build fails: `Invalid server environment variables` (Arabic output) | One of the 4 env vars is missing/invalid **in Vercel project settings**. Add it (Section 3), then Redeploy. Verify locally with `pnpm vercel:check`.                                                  |
| Build fails: cannot find `@/generated/prisma/client`                | Should not happen (postinstall + buildCommand both generate). If you overrode the build command, ensure it runs `prisma generate` before `next build`.                                                |
| Build succeeds, every page errors at runtime (`P1001` / connection) | `DATABASE_URL` unreachable from Vercel: check Neon project is alive (idle-suspended — wake in console), the string ends with `?sslmode=require`, and Neon's network access allows Vercel.             |
| Login/redirect loops or 403 on auth routes                          | `BETTER_AUTH_URL` ≠ actual domain. Set it to the exact production URL (https, no trailing slash) and redeploy.                                                                                        |
| Auth works on production but not on `*.vercel.app` preview URLs     | Expected — previews aren't in `trustedOrigins`. Test auth on the production domain.                                                                                                                   |
| `/api/health` returns old version after a release                   | Bump `version` in `package.json` (health reports it verbatim) and redeploy.                                                                                                                           |
| `/api/health` says `"deploymentReady": false`                       | Read `database` / `missingEnvVars` in the same response: unreachable DB → wake the Neon project (idle suspend) and check `?sslmode=require`; missing vars → add them in Vercel settings and redeploy. |
| Installed PWA shows old UI after a deploy                           | The service worker updates on next visit (network-first navigations). Hard-refresh once or bump `VERSION` in `public/sw.js`.                                                                          |
| First request after idle is slow (~1s)                              | Neon cold start — normal on free plans. Acceptable at pilot scale.                                                                                                                                    |
| `pnpm deploy:*` says "not linked to a Vercel project"               | Run `vercel link` (or `pnpm dlx vercel@latest link`) once, or use the GitHub-connected flow (Section 2).                                                                                              |
| Deploy gate aborts at environment validation                        | `pnpm vercel:check` output lists each variable, its problem, and the exact fix — fix locally in `.env.local` or in Vercel settings.                                                                   |

Still stuck? `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (local issues) and the Vercel
deployment log (Builds → failed deployment → inspect) cover the rest.
